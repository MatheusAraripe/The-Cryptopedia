# The Cryptopedia

Cryptopedia is a website where you can keep up to date with everything that is happening in the crypto world. 
With this cryptocurrency fad, many people started to be interested and even invest in them. However, many inexperienced investors
they only follow the charts and forget that the news influences a good part of the prices of the currencies. I hope cryptopedia helps people stay up to date on crypto world prices and news.

This app was built using react and redux. To have access to news and prices I used Coinranking API and Bing News Search API,
both taken from from the [rapidApi](https://rapidapi.com/hub).
